# CLAUDE.md

GBrain is a personal knowledge brain. Postgres + pgvector + hybrid search in a managed Supabase instance.

## Architecture

Contract-first: `src/core/operations.ts` defines ~30 shared operations. CLI and MCP
server are both generated from this single source. Skills are fat markdown files
(tool-agnostic, work with both CLI and plugin contexts).

## Key files

- `src/core/operations.ts` — Contract-first operation definitions (the foundation)
- `src/core/engine.ts` — Pluggable engine interface (BrainEngine)
- `src/core/postgres-engine.ts` — Postgres + pgvector implementation
- `src/core/db.ts` — Connection management, schema initialization
- `src/core/import-file.ts` — importFromFile + importFromContent (chunk + embed + tags)
- `src/core/sync.ts` — Pure sync functions (manifest parsing, filtering, slug conversion)
- `src/core/chunkers/` — 3-tier chunking (recursive, semantic, LLM-guided)
- `src/core/search/` — Hybrid search: vector + keyword + RRF + multi-query expansion + dedup
- `src/core/embedding.ts` — OpenAI text-embedding-3-large, batch, retry, backoff
- `src/mcp/server.ts` — MCP stdio server (generated from operations)
- `src/schema.sql` — Full Postgres + pgvector DDL (includes files table)
- `openclaw.plugin.json` — ClawHub bundle plugin manifest

## Commands

Run `gbrain --help` or `gbrain --tools-json` for full command reference.

## Testing

`bun test` runs all tests (4 test files). Tests: `test/markdown.test.ts`
(frontmatter parsing, round-trip serialization), `test/chunkers/recursive.test.ts`
(delimiter splitting, overlap, chunk sizing), `test/sync.test.ts` (manifest parsing,
isSyncable filtering, pathToSlug conversion), `test/parity.test.ts` (operations
contract parity between CLI, MCP, and tools-json).

## Skills

Read the skill files in `skills/` before doing brain operations. They contain the
workflows, heuristics, and quality rules for ingestion, querying, maintenance,
enrichment, and setup. 7 skills: ingest, query, maintain, enrich, briefing,
migrate, setup.

## Build

`bun build --compile --outfile bin/gbrain src/cli.ts`

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
